## API for foreign currency
fastFOREX provides a fast, simple & easy-to-integrate API for foreign currency exchange rate data.

https://api.fastforex.io/fetch-all?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY

Note: the API KEY is just free for 7 days, so if the app can not working
maybe it's because the first Forex api key to expired.

## Layout library
`Material UI version 5`

## Handle form and validation
`react-hook-form and yup`

I've used Formik and React Hook Form, I appreciate RHF more because of its ease of use, flexibility, hook and yup support, etc.
Although there are a few points that it's not as good as Formik, I think it's time.
In the near future, the RHF will be more complete.
